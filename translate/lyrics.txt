Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Though you can't see the sun
A new day has begun
And I fall out of bed to a siren call
In the frame on the wall see you in fire
You guys are smiling at me and you inspire
Not good enough
If I just let them get away
Not satisfied until I'm making 'em pay!
I'm a fool for adventure, you know?
Inside my heart feelin' the Inferno!
Barely catchin' my breath
Lay my eyes on the crest
Gonna square up to all of the heat that is left
So, I carry the torch to Inferno! Inferno!
It's out of the park and I'm smilin' again
Here we go
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you wherever you go
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you
Wherever you go
Yeah, I know
Say I don't understand
But I don't give a damn
Even told me that I wouldn't reach the top
But I follow my grandfathers' journey
I know I can be the man that I should be
I down a coffee, grab my axe and then I'm out
I got a rage inside that's making me shout
I get high on the fighting, you know?
Inside my heart feelin' the Inferno!
Barely catchin' my breath
Lay my eyes on the crest
Gonna square up to all of the heat that is left
So, I carry the torch to Inferno! Inferno!
It's out of the park and I'm smilin' again
Here we go
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you wherever you go
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you wherever you go
Yeah, I know
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
All my life been searching for
The place I lost it's what I adore
And all my life been hoping for
A happy life for me
Barely catchin' my breath
Lay my eyes on the crest
Gonna square up to all of the heat that is left
So, I carry the torch to Inferno! Inferno!
It's out of the park
And I'm smilin' again
Here we go
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you wherever you go
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I will be here for you wherever you go
Yeah, I know
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
Trails of fire
You always knew
They would carry me home
They'd lead me to you
